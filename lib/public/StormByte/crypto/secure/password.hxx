			 *
			 * Bytes live in shared storage allocated by this library and are wiped
			 * when the last owner is destroyed. Copies share the same buffer. There
			 * is no public view of the raw bytes: once ingested, the secret only
			 * exists inside this object (and any @ref StormByte::Crypto::Secure::Vault
			 * that still holds a share).
			 *
			 * ## Why ingest is a non-const reference, not a view and not a move
			 *
			 * A password that stays in the caller's `std::string` / @ref StormByte::String::String
			 * after construction is a leftover secret. `std::string_view` cannot wipe
			 * that source (it does not own it) and would encourage keeping the
			 * original buffer alive. Passing `std::string` by value or by move across
			 * a DLL boundary is also unsafe: the string's buffer is allocated by the
			 * caller's CRT/heap, and destroying or moving it inside this library can
			 * free the wrong heap.
			 *
			 * Therefore the caller *cedes* a non-const `std::string&` or
			 * `StormByte::String::String&`. This constructor copies the bytes into
			 * wiped storage owned by this library and then overwrites and clears the
			 * caller's object. After return the argument is empty; the only remaining
			 * copy is the one Password owns.
			 *
			 * String literals (`Password("secret")`) use `const char*`. They are
			 * copied and the source is not wiped: a literal lives in read-only
			 * storage. That form is for tests and non-secret placeholders, not for
			 * production secrets typed in source.
			 *
			 * Raw bytes (`const void*` + @ref StormByte::ByteSize) are copied and
			 * not wiped; the caller is responsible for the source buffer.
